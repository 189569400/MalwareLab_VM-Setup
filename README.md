# DissectingMalwa.re Lab VMs

This repository contains my download/setup script for the Virtual Machines I use for Malware Analysis and Software Reverse Engineering. 

## Features

* The purpose of the script is to download tools, not install them. This leaves the choice of what and where to install it to the user.
* No BoxStarter/Chocolatey trouble! What good is an automated install if it fails halfway through? I'm just not a big fan of it ðŸ¤·
* Python-free zone: IMO Python and Windows don't mix well, which is why I run basically all Python Tools in a Linux VM (check out [REMNUX](https://remnux.org/) or [Tsurugi](https://tsurugi-linux.org/))
* Separate Static Code Analysis and Dynamic Analysis VMs. YMMV but this is the approach I prefer!
* Only install Open Source Tools with the ```-opensource true``` argument (this might be useful if you want to use this script in a professional setting)
* Apply system modifications like: disable ASLR, fix Explorer file/folder views
* Preload debugging symbols for offline use (more on this in the Installation section below)

## Installation

1. Setup a fresh Windows VM with the Hypervisor you trust or download a [modern.ie VM](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/) (note that this script is meant to run on x64 VMs)
2. Download/clone this repository and run ```vm_setup.ps1``` with PowerShell

## Why not FLARE-VM etc. ?

As I mentioned below I am not a big fan of the Boxstarter/Chocolatey install mechanism. Furthermore I prefer to download the tools directly from the developer if possible and choose the e.g. installation path myself. Lastly I like to separate my Static Code Analysis VM from my Dynamic Analysis VM for a couple of reasons: less clutter, faster snapshot restore times, parallel working, to prevent license key theft and so on...

**Nevertheless other VM setup scripts might work better for you, so choose whatever floats your boat and (mis)trust your tools!** 

Here are some great alternatives to my script:
* [Fireeye FLARE-VM](https://github.com/fireeye/flare-vm)
* [SentinelLabs RevCore Tools](https://github.com/SentineLabs/SentinelLabs_RevCore_Tools)

## Customization

Again, there might be one or two tools missing or superfluous for your workflow. Should this be the case you can simply remove them from the ```.json``` files after cloning the repository to your machine or forking it. Feel free to contribute useful Tools (see [below](https://github.com/f0wl/MalwareLab_VM-Setup/main/README.md#contributing))!

## Tools and Licensing

In the collapsible section below you can find a list of all tools available to download via the script.

## Contributing

If you have any suggestions for awesome tools that are missing on these lists and that everyone would profit from or you spot an error somewhere: feel free to open an Issue or send a Pull Request. Same goes for outdated links to packages! Thank you :)

### A few guidelines:

* Directly link to the original download site provided by the developer whenever possible
* Remember to insert the tool and license link into the Readme
* Please stick to the static/dynamic compartmentalization
* If there is no way around an awesome Python Tool please make sure it runs on Python3 and is actively maintained
